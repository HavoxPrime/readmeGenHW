![Example console output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HavoxPrime/readmeGenHW/main/imgs/console-output.PNG)

-I kept fliping on how i wanted to do the bages because shield.io has a bage that updates based on what license it finds in the repo but that didn't work for this project unless i was to create a .txt file with the license for them and push it to their repo.
